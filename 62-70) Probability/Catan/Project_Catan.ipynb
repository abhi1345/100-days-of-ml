    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of the game is to get $10$ victory points as fast as possible. To get these points, the player must choose a wise trade-off between spending resources to potentially obtain points and upgrading their modes of production. You, the chieftain of the island, must decide where and when to build additional <font color=purple>settlements</font> on the island to boost your resource production, with roads to connect them. Alternatively, you can invest into development cards, which will bring you a victory point, or upgrade a settlement into a <font color=blue>city</font> which doubles production and gives you another victory point. A settlement / city must border on a resource field in order to harvest its resources. We will have three different terrains: forests, which produce <font color=brown>wood</font>, hills which produce <font color=red>brick</font>, and fields of <font color=gray>grain</font> (grain). Additionally we have <font color=khaki>desert</font> which provide no resources. Every turn, we roll two dice and record the sum $X$. The settlements that are next to the tile that is labelled with $X$ get one resource from that field, and we keep collecting resources and building up to 10 victory points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game layout\n",
    "\n",
    "Our modified Catan board is drawn below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiles are color coded with the resource they produce: <font color=brown>wood</font>, <font color=red>brick</font>, <font color=green>grain</font>. (and <font color=khaki>desert</font>)\n",
    "\n",
    "You build <font color=purple>settlements</font> and <font color=blue>cities</font> on vertices of the board. The small purple square is a settlement, labeled \"1\" because it gives you one resource of the surrounding tiles when the corresponding number is rolled. The small blue square is a city and gives you 2 resources from surrounding tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "These settlements and cities must be connected by roads (white)."

    "## Rules\n",
    "When implementing your Catan strategy, remember to follow these rules:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Every turn you roll 2 dice, call the sum X </li>\n",
    "<li> Find tiles labeled with the number X and collect one of that resource for every settlement and two of that resource for every city on a vertex of that tile (this logic is implemented for you already) </li>\n",
    "<li> If a 7 is rolled, the player must dump resources until their total resource count is below the max resource limit. </li>\n",
    "<!---<li> You can never have more than 6 of any resource: if you get extra, you just keep 6 </li>--->\n",
    "<li> You can trade 4 resources of the same kind for a resource of your choice (i.e. 4 grain for 1 wood) </li>\n",
    "<li> If you have a settlement or a city built on one of the 4 ports (4 corners), you can trade at a discount <ul>\n",
    "<li> Bottom left hand corner: wood port, trade 2 wood for 1 of any other resource </li>\n",
    "<li> Bottom right hand corner: brick port, trade 2 brick for 1 of any other resource </li>\n",
    "<li> Upper left hand corner: grain port, trade 2 grain for 1 of any other resource </li>\n",
    "<li> Upper right hand corner: general port, trade 3 of any resource for 1 of any other resource </li>\n",
    "</ul></li>\n",
    "<li>Settlements must be connected by roads </li>\n",
    "<li>Roads must be connected to settlements / cities or other roads </li>\n",
    "<li>Settlements cannot be built adjacent to other settlements or cities </li>\n",
    "<li> You can build by paying resources according to the costs below, and building any non-road item (including buying a development card) gives you 1 victory point </li>\n",
    "<li> You start the game off with 3 of each resource and no buildings </li>\n",
    "<li> You may make as many purchases as you want per turn </li>\n",
    "<li> You are alloted 3 minutes of computation time per 100 games over a fixed board. </li>\n",
    "    <ul> <li> You are free to divide this time between planBoard and realtime computation as you wish\n",
    "        </li> </ul>\n",

    "\n",
    "The constructor initializes our Catan board. Dice and resources must be the same shape: HxW where H is the height of the board and W is the width. dice[i,j] is the dice number that tile corresponds to (each element between 2-12 inclusive) and resources[i,j] is the resource that tile  provides. Settlements is a dictionary mapping vertices with settlements on them to player ids, and likewise for cities.\n",

    "\n",
    "`player.trade(r_in,r_out)`\n",
    "Trades resource r_in for r_out with ratio 4:1, unless player owns a port allowing for better trades. Throws an exception if player does not have the required amount of resource r_in to complete the trade.\n",
