    "An auction has a <b>seller</b>, who is trying to sell <b>one</b> item. Multiple <b>buyers</b> (synonymous with \"bidder\") - there are $n$ of them - are interested in purchasing this item, but the item can only be sold to one buyer. Each buyer associates a value to an item (how much is this item worth <i>to them</i>). These values usually differ and may or may not be independent of one another. Call buyer $i$'s value of an item $x_i$. Each buyer then bids $\\beta_i (x_i)$, a function of $x_i$. This is person $i$'s bidding function. The seller then sells the item to one of the buyers according to some mechanism $M$. \n",

    "<li> Anonymity: The only thing that matters is the buyer's bid, not the identity of the buyer (more formally, if buyer $i$ offers $x_i$ and wins against buyer $j$ who offers $x_j$, then buyer $j$ would win if she would offer $x_i + \\epsilon$);</li>\n",
    "<li> Privacy: Buyer $i$ only knows the value $x_i$ and does not know any bids or valuations $\\beta_j \\text{ or } x_j \\ \\forall j\\neq i$;</li>\n",
    "<li> All auctions are sealed-bid auctions: Every buyer submits the bid simultaneously.</li>\n",
