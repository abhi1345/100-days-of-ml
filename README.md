2. k Nearest Neighbor Classifier + Regressor

3. Naive Bayes Classifier for Spam Classification - Bag of Words model

4. Logistic Regression for (x1,x2) -> (0 or 1) classification - Stochastic Gradient Descent

5. Linear Discriminant Analysis for Multiclass Classification

6. Decision Tree for 2-class Classification

7. Learning Vector Quantization for binary classification

8. Support Vector Machine with Sub-Gradient Descent

## Days 9 - 11: Kaggle (ML Applied to Data Science Challenges)
